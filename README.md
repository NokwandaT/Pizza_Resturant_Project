# Pizza_Resturant_Project
#The project involves creating a tailor-made relational database for a new pizzeria. The project utilizes tools such as Excel for data organization, Quick Database Diagrams for database design, and SQL for creating and managing the database. Additionally, Looker Studio is used for data visualization and is integrated with Google Cloud Console for secure and scalable data storage and processing.
 SITUATION
Ben is opening a new pizzeria in his town, focusing on take-out and delivery services similar to Domino's. He has provided a project brief to design and build a tailor-made relational database for his business, which will capture and store essential information related to customer orders, stock levels, and staff management. The database will enable him to monitor business performance and will be used to create interactive dashboards for this purpose.
TASK
The first part of the project involves designing and building an orders table for the database. This table needs to include columns for item name, item category, item size, item price, quantity, customer first name, customer last name, delivery address, and other relevant details. The task also includes normalizing the data, adding related tables, and defining table relationships to ensure data efficiency and flexibility.
ACTION
The project involves creating separate tables for customers, orders, address, item, recipe, ingredient, inventory, rota, shift, and staff. Each table is given a unique ID and then connected to one another via this key. The database is then exported for use in MySQL. The project also includes creating a dashboard for the database, which will be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of the pizzeria.
RESULT
The completion of this project will provide Ben with a comprehensive database that effectively handles customer orders, ensures optimal stock management, and facilitates efficient staff management. The interactive dashboards created from this database will enable Ben to monitor and evaluate the performance of his business, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
